        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-5">Edge functions, Serverless Functions and Edge Middleware should all be utilized based on specific requirements of what you are building and how the feature will be interacted with for the best UX possible. By understanding each use-case you should better be able to make a decision on which technology you will employ.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Edge Functions</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-5">Ideal for scenarios where you need to run code geographically closer to your users for improved performance. Edge Functions are executed at the edge of the network, which reduces latency by minimizing the distance the data has to travel. They&apos;re perfect for tasks like personalization, A/B testing, or utilizing feature flags for users in a given location.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Serverless Functions</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-5">These are best for backend operations that don&lsquo;t require the low-latency benefits of edge computing. Serverless Functions in Vercel allow you to deploy server-side code without having to manage a server infrastructure. They&apos;re great for handling database operations, authentication, etc.</p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Edge Middleware</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-5">This is particularly effective for implementing caching strategies, such as defining eviction policies or determining conditions under which certain content should never be cached, based on the user&apos;s location. This capability makes it a powerful tool for optimizing content delivery and ensuring that users receive the most relevant and up-to-date information.</p>
